### Status 20200124

#### UPD: Tinkerforge MQTT Bindings 2

This requires high effort as the MQTT concept has changed.

**Considerations**
* Rebuild from scratch as WeatherCubeThree
* Instead MakerBeam create custom creation using LEGOÂ® basic bricks & technic bricks (LEGO is a trademark of the LEGO Group)
